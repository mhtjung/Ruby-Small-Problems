1. The first call throws an IndexError because the there is no index 7 (a.length < 7)
2. The second call returns "beats me" because the second parameter passed in is used when the method cannot find the specified value.
3. The third call returns the 49 because the block only executes when an invalid index is used. So, since 7 is used, we return 7**2.
